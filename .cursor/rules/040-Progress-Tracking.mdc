### Progress-Log editing rules

* **Never remove rows**; history must stay append-only.  
* Keep the table columns: `Date (UTC) | Phase | Summary | Next action`.  
* Use ISO 8601 date (`2025-06-09`).  
* “Phase” is an integer 0–10; if a sub-step is necessary use suffix “a/b/c”.  
* Verb-leading summary, ≤ 80 chars.  
* Next action is always framed as an imperative, e.g. “Write failing test for operator+”.  
* After commit/tag, reflect that in the summary (`commit a1b2c3d`, `tag phase-2-done`).
